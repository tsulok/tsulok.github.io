description: Between 2015 and 2018 I was mainly working on enterprise projects provided to one of the biggest consulting company. 75% of them were B2B iPad applications with huge databases (thousands of pdfs, images & videos) and very sensitive (also valuable) datasets. These applications focused on impressive user interfaces, secure networking & caching. <p>Beside B2B applications we created several other in house applications most importantly a human resource manager application, which nearly took 2000 development hours until the first release for a team of four. It contains over 50 screens, real time VPN secured inapp messaging (with socket communications) and endless use cases. <p>In the beginning of 2018 I've been sent to abroad locations to work closely with the clients and digitalize their solutions to mobile.</p> <p>Due to strictly confidential contracts neither the name of the above mentioned projects can be told.</p>
